A queen in chess can make any amount of spaces left,right,up,down, or diagonally.
You will recieve a 2d array of chars, containing empty spaces, a single 'q' (representing the queen),
and some 'p' (representing pawns)
Your task is to return the number of free spaces that the queen could move to on this board, without capturing any pawns.
The space that the queen starts on is not included.

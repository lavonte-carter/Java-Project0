You recieve an array of doubles, which represent the sequential prices of a stock throughout the day.
Your task is to return a string containing the best index to buy 1 stock and the best index to sell that same stock
in order to maximize profit on the buying and selling of that one stock.
You can assume that the stock price increases compared to the previous hour at some point in the day.
(indexes indicate the start of an hour)
Example output:

Buy 4 Sell 21
Buy 19 Sell 23
Buy 3 Sell 4

note: time does not flow backwards.

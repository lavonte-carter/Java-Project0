# Java-Project0
The project0 replicates functions of an atm machine. 
The atm is connected to a PostgreSQL database system.
DBeaver was used as a method to manage and communicate with the database.
This atm machine has CRUD (Create, Read/Retrieve, Update and Delete) functionality.
This atm machine was created with Log4j logs in the 'login' section of MainAtm and 'update password' section.
The current version of this atm machine does not have withdrawal capabilities, creating new accounts, removing accounts, and updating the password.
        Note: the developer will continue to work on adding withdrawal to the atm machine.

The code is being stored in the database and has the ability to update upon new entries.




                                              ~~~NOTICE~~~
****Future versions of this program would expect to include: JUNIT testing, and withdrawal capabilities.****

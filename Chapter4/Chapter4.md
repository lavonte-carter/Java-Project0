Now that you've gotten some programming experience under your belt, it's time to deep dive into Java, and complicated problems that will require you to understand sets of data. Your first entry into these types of problems can be daunting: you're no longer working with an atomic predictable input, but rather a set of data, be it a file, list, array, or string. For this reason, I recommend using real-world materials (pencil and paper) to map out how a particular problem can be navigated.

By the end of this chapter, you should understand
* Java's full scale of OOP functionality (overriding, generics, interfaces, access modifiers)
* The basic syntax of how to use maps, queues, and stacks
* Some more methods for strings
* How custom exceptions are written
* How runtimeexceptions are different from regular exceptions
